# Requirements

# General

* Allowed editors: ``vi``, ``vim``, ``emacs``
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on ```Ubuntu 20.04 LTS``` using ```python3 (version 3.8.5)```
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/python3```
* A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the ```pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)```
* All your files must be ```executable```
* The length of your files will be tested using ``wc```
* All your modules should have a documentation ```(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')```
* All your classes should have a documentation ```(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')```
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation ```(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')```
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

# More Info
Documentation is now mandatory! Each module, class, and method must contain docstring as comments.
